# yake_keywords_extractor

For automatic keyword extraction in Yake, text features are exploited in an unsupervised manner.
YAKE is a basic unsupervised automatic keyword extraction method that identifies the most relevant keywords in a text by
using text statistical data from single texts. 
This technique does not rely on dictionaries, external corpora, text size, language, or domain, and it does not require 
training on a specific set of documents. The Yake algorithmâ€™s major characteristics are as follows:
* Unsupervised approach
* Corpus-Independent
* Domain and Language Independent
* Single-Document
